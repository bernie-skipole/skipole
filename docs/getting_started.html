<h3>Skipole - Getting Started</h3>
<p>Assuming you have installed skipole, the package can be imported into your code like any Python package, using 'import skipole'.</p>
<p>The associated package skilift provides a useful feature when run directly. In which case it creates a skeleton project, together with needed support files.</p>
<p>You can create a directory where projects will be developed, and a new project 'myproj'.</p>
<p><strong>python3 -m skilift myproj /path/to/my/projectfiles</strong></p>
<p>You should replace 'myproj' with your preferred name for a new project.</p>
<p>The /path/to/my/projectfiles should be a directory where you will be developing your new project.</p>
<p>The projectfiles directory will be created with your new project 'myproj' within it:</p>
<p>...projectfiles/myproj.py</p>
<p>...projectfiles/myproj/data/....</p>
<p>...projectfiles/myproj/static/....</p>
<p>Multiple projects can be created in one 'projectfiles' directory, or you could have multiple such directories holding different projects.</p>
<p>If the directory already exists, and if myproj already exists in the directory, it will not be changed.</p>
<p>The python file myproj.py contains code which imports skipole, and generates the wsgi application, and functions which you will develop further yourself. It is strongly commented so you should inspect it, its contents are shown at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>Having created the project, you would then run:</p>
<p><strong>python3 /path/to/my/projectfiles/myproj.py</strong></p>
<p>This should display "Serving myproj on port 8000. Call http://localhost:8000/skiadmin to edit.</p>
<p>Then connect with a browser to localhost:8000 to view the project, and call localhost:8000/skiadmin to open an administrative site to add and edit folders and pages.</p>
<h3>myproj.py</h3>
<p>The initial content of the skeleton myproj.py file is shown below, you would normally develop this further, and these documentation pages give further information.</p>

import os

# from skipole import the WSGIApplication class which will be used to create a wsgi application

from skipole import WSGIApplication, FailPage, GoTo, ValidateError, ServerError, ServeFile, use_submit_list, skis, PageData, SectionData, set_debug

# FailPage, GoTo, ValidateError, ServerError, ServeFile are exception classes which you can raise in your own code

# use_submit_list is a decorator described below

# skis is another skipole project which serves javascript files and its use is shown below

# PageData and SectionData are dictionary-like objects with attributes. Your code sets contents into
# these which will be applied to the page finally returned to the user.

# set_debug(True) causes exception information to be displayed, a deployed site should normally
# have the default set_debug(False)

# the framework needs to know the location of the projectfiles directory holding the project data
# and static files.

PROJECTFILES = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))
PROJECT = "myproj"

# This file myproj.py is initially created under the projectfiles directory, however it does not
# need to be sited there, and can be moved and your code developed elsewhere. The above PROJECTFILES
# path is only needed to set the location of the support files used by the project, not code. 

# proj_data is an optional dictionary of values which you are free to use, it will be made
# available to your functions as the attribute 'skicall.proj_data'

PROJ_DATA={}


# Your code needs to provide your own version of the following three functions which will
# be used to set values into the widgets of returned pages. Minimal versions are provided below.

# When a call is received by the server, the framework converts the url called to a 'called_ident'
# which is a tuple (projectname, pagenumber), and then, if this is the project called, this
# start_call function is called. If the page called is not recognised, called_ident will be None.

# The skicall object has attributes and methods pertaining to the call. 


def start_call(called_ident, skicall):
    """When a call is initially received this function is called.
       Unless you want to divert to another page, this function should return called_ident which
       would typically be the ident of a Responder or Template page dealing with the call.
       If a ServeFile exception is raised, which contains a pathlib.Path object of a local server
       file then that server file will be sent to the client. In this case, the end_call function
       will not be called."""
    # To serve a directory of static files, you can map a url to a server directory with the
    # skicall.map_url_to_server method, which returns pathlib.Path objects, and then
    # raise a ServeFile exception, which causes the file to be served. For example:
    # servedfile = skicall.map_url_to_server("images", "/home/user/thisproject/imagefiles")
    # if servedfile:
    #    raise ServeFile(servedfile)

    # Of particular interest at this point are the attributes:
    # skicall.received_cookies is a dictionary of cookie name:values received from the client
    # skicall.call_data is a dictionary which you can set with your own data and, as skicall is
    # passed on to the submit_data and end_call functions defined below, can be used to pass
    # data to these functions.

    # Normally you would return called_ident, which is the page being called, or None to cause a
    # page not found error, or another ident (project, pagenumber) to divert the call to another page.

    return called_ident

# After start_call, if the call is passed to a Responder page which you have set up to call
# submit_data, then the function below will be called.
#
# You may wish to apply the decorator '@use_submit_list' to this submit_data function. This
# takes the package, module and function name which you have set in the Responder's 'submit list'
# and imports and calls that specified function instead. This is entirely optional. 

def submit_data(skicall):
    """This function is called when a Responder wishes to submit data for processing in some manner
       Typically you would create a PageData object containing widget,field values and call the
       skicall.update method, where the data will be applied to the page returned"""
    # For example, if you have a page with a widget 'displaydata' and with a field 'hide' which you want
    # to set to True, you would use:
    #   pd = PageData()
    #   pd['displaydata','hide'] = True
    #   pd['otherwidgets', 'otherfields'] = 'Other values'
    # You may also have a section in the page, with a section alias of "mysection"
    #   sd = SectionData("mysection")
    #   sd['anotherwidget', 'widgetfield'] = "Text displayed on widget"
    # And then update pd with this section data
    #   pd.update(sd)
    # and finally, you would set the pd into skicall using update
    #   skicall.update(pd)

    return


def end_call(page_ident, page_type, skicall):
    """This function is called prior to returning a page,
       it can also be used to return an optional session cookie string."""
    # If you have created a PageData object and stored it in skicall.call_data
    # this would be a good place to call skicall.update(pd)
    # so the data is set into the page prior to returning the page to the user.
    return


# The above functions are required as arguments to the skipole.WSGIApplication object
# and will be called as required.

# create the wsgi application
application = WSGIApplication(project=PROJECT,
                              projectfiles=PROJECTFILES,
                              proj_data=PROJ_DATA,
                              start_call=start_call,

                              proj_ident=None)


# Add the 'skis' application which serves javascript and css files required by
# the framework widgets.

# The skipole.skis package, contains the function makeapp() - which returns a
# WSGIApplication object which is then appended to your own project

skis_application = skis.makeapp()
application.add_project(skis_application, url='/lib')

# The add_project method of WSGIApplication enables the added sub application
# to be served at a URL which should extend the URL of the main 'root' application.
# The above shows the main application served at "/" and the skis library
# project served at "/lib"

# You can add further sub applications using the add_project method which has signature
# application.add_project(subapplication, url=None, check_cookies=None)
# The optional check_cookies argument can be set to a function which you would create, with signature:
# def my_check_cookies_function(received_cookies, proj_data):
# Before the call is routed to the subapplication, your my_check_cookies_function is called, with the
# received_cookies dictionary, and with your application's proj_data dictionary. If your function
# returns None, the call proceeds unhindered to the subapplication. If however your function returns
# an ident tuple, of the form (projectname, pagenumber), then the call is routed to that page instead.

# Normally, when deploying on a web server, you would follow the servers
# own documentation which should describe how to load a wsgi application.
# for example, using gunicorn3 by command line

# gunicorn3 -w 4 myproj:application

# Where gunicorn3 is the python3 version of gunicorn
