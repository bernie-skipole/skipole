<h3>skicall</h3>
<p>The skicall object passed to your functions has several attributes, most provide you with information - some you can alter:</p>
<p>skicall.accesstextblocks is the project instance of the AccessTextBlocks class, most users will not need this, but it may be required for certain applications.</p>
<p>skicall.call_data is a dictionary which could contain data you set into it or could contain submitted form data (depending on the Responder handling the call).</p>
<p>skicall.caller_ident is the ident of the page making the call, a tuple ('projname', pagenumber), generally sent with any submitted data, this value could be an empty tuple if the page ident is not known - which will happen if the calling page is external or if no data is submitted.</p>
<p>skicall.environ is the wsgi environ dictionary.</p>
<p>skicall.ident_data is a string which was previously saved onto the page by setting skicall.page_data['ident_data'], and has now been sent back together with any submitted data. skicall.ident_data will be None if not present.<br />This facility can be used to pass data between calls. You need to validate this received string as it can be altered by a malicious caller.</p>
<p>skicall.ident_list is initially an empty list but will have the ident ('projname', pagenumber) of each responder handling the call appended to it. Typically a call will be handled by a single responder, but it is possible for one responder to pass the call on to another, and so several may be involved in a call.</p>
<p>skicall.lang is a read-only tuple of two strings containing the preferred language required by the client in the format (language, default_language).<br />
This attribute is used when requesting TextBlocks.</p>
<p>skicall.language is a string such as 'en' being the preferred language required by the client, initially taken from the client browser's language setting, or from a received language cookie. If changed it will cause a language cookie to be set. It may be that the client browser preferred language is not available, hence this is independent of the skicall.page_data['lang'] setting - which, if used, sets the page html tag 'lang' attribute.</p>
<p>skicall.page_data is a dictionary to be populated by your functions during the progress of this call.<br />
It consists of a dictionary of {widgfields:values,...} which will be set in the final template page.</p>
<p>Note: a widgfield is a tuple ('widgetname', 'fieldname'), or a tuple ('sectionalias','widgetname', 'fieldname') if the widget is part of a section. </p>
<p>skicall.path is the URL path to the page called.</p>
<p>skicall.proj_data is a project attribute, a dictionary set when creating the skipole.WSGIApplication object. It could be used for your own purpose - for example to input a database password when the program is started.</p>
<p>skicall.project is the project name.</p>
<p>skicall.projectfiles is the string path to the 'projectfiles' directory of data and static files. Each project's specific directory can be found beneath it - that is, in the '..projectfiles/myproject/' directory.</p>
<p>skicall.received_cookies is a dictionary of cookie name:values received from the client. Note, that if skicall.language is set, a cookie value received will appear in this dictionary with key 'language'.</p>
<p>skicall.rootproject will be True if this is the root project, False if it is a sub project.</p>
<p>skicall.submit_list is a list set by a responder.</p>
<p>skicall.submit_dict is a dictionary set by a responder.</p>
<h3>METHODS</h3>
<p>skicall.label_value(label, project=None) is a method which given a label, returns the associated ident or URL.<br />If project is not given assumes the current project, if given, project must exist as either the root, or a sub project of the root. If no label is found, returns None.</p>
<p>skicall.textblock(textref, project=None) is a method which given a reference string returns the text of the associated TextBlock.<br />If project is None, it assumes the TextBlock is defined in the current project, if project is given it must be the root or a sub project. If no TextBlock is found, it returns None.</p>
<p>skicall.projectpaths() returns a dictionary of project names as keys with the project paths as values.</p>
