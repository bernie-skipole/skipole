Note, that if a language cookie is set by a LanguageCookie responder, the cookie value received will be set in the 'lang' tuple, and will also appear in this dictionary with key 'language'.\r\n\r\nident_data is a string which was previously saved onto the page making the call by setting page_data['ident_data'], and has now been sent back together with any submitted data.\r\nThis facility can therefore be used to pass a reference identifier between calls. You need to validate this string here as it can be altered by a malicious caller. ident_data will be None if not present.\r\n\r\nlang is a tuple of two strings containing the preferred language required by the client in the format (language, default_language).

This function typically should populate the page_data dictionary, usually with widgfields as keys, and values to insert into the fields.\r\n\r\nA Responder is chosen from a list of Responders by yourself, and added to this site like any other page. Each Responder has a different functionality. Certain Responders call this submit_data function. Typically a client web browser would make a call to a Responder, which would validate the call, set data into the call_data dictionary, and then call the submit_data function.  Responders generally are set with a target ident - generally the ident of a template page, which will have its widgets populated by the page_data dictionary.\r\n\r\nThe Responder calling this function should specify what it wants returned in its documentation.\r\nMost Responders require 'None' to be returned, but, for example, the LogIn Responder requires a session string.\r\n\r\nNote: a widgfield is a tuple ('widgetname', 'fieldname'), or a tuple ('sectionalias', 'widgetname', 'fieldname') if the widget is part of a section.\r\n\r\ncaller_ident is the ident of the page making the call, a tuple ('projname', pagenumber), generally sent with any submitted data, this value could be an empty tuple if the page ident is not known - which will happen if the calling page is external or if no data is submitted.\r\n\r\nIt is possible for one Responder to pass the call to another, therefore this function could be called multiple times within a single call, ident_list is the list of such Responder idents called - the first item being the Responder ident called by the user, the last entry being the Responder ident that called this function.\r\nEach item in the list is a tuple of the form ('projname', pagenumber).\r\n\r\nsubmit_list is a list of strings which may be submitted by the Responder calling this function.\r\nThey are optionally used for your convenience, and set when you add a Responder to the project. If the 'use_submit_list' decorator is used, the submit_list can be used the define an alternative function to submit_data. See the information about 'use_submit_list'.\r\n\r\nsubmit_dict is a dictionary which may be submitted by the Responder calling this function.\r\nThe use depends on the Responder - read the Responder documentation.\r\n\r\ncall_data is the dictionary previously returned by start_call, it will be passed to subsequent Responders during a call.  Your functions can populate it in any way required, however if you wish to clear it, use call_data.clear() rather than deleting it.\r\nTypically a Responder would be used to pass submitted form data into this call_data dictionary prior to this function being called.\r\n\r\nSimilarly page_data is the second dictionary previously returned by start_call, it will also be passed to subsequent Responders during a call.  Your functions can populate it with keys which should be widgfields and values to go in the widget fields.  At the end of the call, these will be inserted into the template or JSON page. If you wish to clear this dictionary, use page_data.clear() rather than deleting it.\r\n\r\nlang is the tuple (language, default_language) provided by start_call.\r\n\r\nOn returning from this function the call will be passed to the Responder's target page, which could typically be a template page (in which case your end_call function will be called next) or it could be another Responder.

  "page.85001": "These operations manipulate multiple pages across your project.\r\n\r\nWidget default CSS classes:\r\nThe first option on this page deals with CSS classes. Widgets have fields of CSS classes which set the look of the widget, and these fields have default values, which are saved in the defaults.json file within the project data directory. The option on this page sets these fields to the default values on all widgets in template pages. Default values are only applied if a default for the widget and field has been set, and only in page widgets - not in sections.\r\n\r\nProject <html> background color:\r\nIn general, the background colour of pages are set in each page 'body' element, however on a slowly loading site, before the body is loaded, it can happen that a brief white page is shown.\r\nOne solution is to set a background colour in the very first 'html' element of the page. Each template page of your project has the option to set this attribute, and for all such pages, you can set the background colour here. This allows you to change this setting across the entire project without editing each page.\r\n\r\nDefault CSS links:\r\nWhen new pages are created, default CSS links can automatically be inserted into the page head section. Set the labels of the default links you wish to insert here. This saves you the trouble of editing the page heads manually every time you create a new page. The list order matches the order in which they will be added.\r\n\r\nDefault javascript links:\r\nSimilarly, when new pages are created, default javascript links can automatically be inserted into the page head section. Set the labels of the default links you wish to insert here. This list should always include 'jquery_core' and 'skipole_js' which are needed for correct operation of the framework widgets. \r\n\r\nSet CSS class in <body> tags:\r\nThe CSS class of the body tag can be set for all template pages in the project. This allows a drastic CSS change throughout the project if required.\r\n\r\nInsert a css link in each page head:\r\nGiven an element or widget description (the brief), this function finds this element in each 'head' section and inserts a CSS link before it. The target of the link being the label set here.\r\n\r\nSet CSS class in elements with given brief:\r\nGiven an element or widget description (the brief), this function finds each element in each 'body' section, and sets that element class attribute with the given CSS class.",
