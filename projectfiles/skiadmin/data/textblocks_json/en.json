Each Responder has a different functionality. Certain Responders call this submit_data function. Typically a client web browser would make a call to a Responder, which would validate the call, set data into the call_data dictionary, and then call the submit_data function.  Responders generally are set with a target ident - generally the ident of a template page, which will have its widgets populated by the page_data dictionary.\r\n\r\nThe Responder calling this function should specify what it wants returned in its documentation.\r\nMost Responders require 'None' to be returned, but, for example, the LogIn Responder requires a session string.\r\n\r\nNote: a widgfield is a tuple ('widgetname', 'fieldname'), or a tuple ('sectionalias', 'widgetname', 'fieldname') if the widget is part of a section.\r\n\r\ncaller_ident is the ident of the page making the call, a tuple ('projname', pagenumber), generally sent with any submitted data, this value could be an empty tuple if the page ident is not known - which will happen if the calling page is external or if no data is submitted.\r\n\r\nIt is possible for one Responder to pass the call to another, therefore this function could be called multiple times within a single call, ident_list is the list of such Responder idents called - the first item being the Responder ident called by the user, the last entry being the Responder ident that called this function.\r\nEach item in the list is a tuple of the form ('projname', pagenumber).\r\n\r\nsubmit_list is a list of strings which may be submitted by the Responder calling this function.\r\nThey are optionally used for your convenience, and set when you add a Responder to the project.\r\n\r\nsubmit_dict is a dictionary which may be submitted by the Responder calling this function.\r\nThe use depends on the Responder - read the Responder documentation.\r\n\r\ncall_data is the dictionary previously returned by start_call, it will be passed to subsequent Responders during a call.  Your functions can populate it in any way required, however if you wish to clear it, use call_data.clear() rather than deleting it.\r\nTypically a Responder would be used to pass submitted form data into this call_data dictionary prior to this function being called.\r\n\r\nSimilarly page_data is the second dictionary previously returned by start_call, it will also be passed to subsequent Responders during a call.  Your functions can populate it with keys which should be widgfields and values to go in the widget fields.  At the end of the call, these will be inserted into the template or JSON page. If you wish to clear this dictionary, use page_data.clear() rather than deleting it.\r\n\r\nlang is the tuple (language, default_language) provided by start_call.\r\n\r\nOn returning from this function the call will be passed to the Responder's target page, which could typically be a template page (in which case your end_call function will be called next) or it could be another Responder.
