However, skis also holds other resources which you may want to use and these are listed here:",
  "aboutcode.1": "To create a new project you would normally run:\r\n\r\npython3 -m skipole myproj /path/to/projectfiles\r\n\r\nYou should replace 'myproj' with your preferred name for a new project.\r\n\r\nA projectfiles directory will be created with your new project 'myproj' within it:\r\n\r\n...projectfiles/myproj.py\r\n...projectfiles/myproj/data/....\r\n...projectfiles/myproj/static/....\r\n\r\nThe file myproj.py is the initial code for your project, and running it will start the project. You could develop it in this location - or move it to a location of your choice. Essentially it imports the WSGIApplication class from skipole, and creates an instance of the class which is your wsgi application.\r\n\r\nMultiple projects can be created in one 'projectfiles' directory, or you could have multiple such directories holding different projects.\r\n\r\nIf the directory already exists, and if myproj already exists in the directory, it will not be changed.\r\n\r\nYour project will initially serve admin pages at /skiadmin which allows you to define your own project pages of various types (html, css and svg) and also 'Responders' which call your functions defined in myproj.py. These page definitions are held as JSON files, which are read by the skipole framework, and are used to return the required content to the caller.",

  "aboutcode.PageData": "Your 'start_call', 'submit_data' and 'end_call' functions are used to populate the skicall object with widget field data which is set into the widget fields of the final template page returned.\r\n\r\nTo do this, create a PageData object.\r\n\r\nfrom skipole import PageData\r\n\r\npd = PageData()\r\n\r\nThis instance is a dictionary-like object that also has certain attributes. It can be set with data, and then inserted into the skicall object with:\r\n\r\nskicall.update(pd)\r\n\r\nThe keys of the PageData instance pd are of the form:\r\n\r\npd[widgetname,fieldname] = value\r\n\r\nThis framework often refers to the key tuple (widgetname,fieldname) as a widgfield.\r\n\r\nAs well as dictionary keys, attributes can be set which override parameters set when the page is created:\r\n\r\nThe http status and headers are normally set automatically by the framework, but can also be set by:\r\n\r\npd.status - Sets the returned page status\r\npd.headers - Sets the returned page headers\r\n\r\nIf pd.headers is not set, then the following individual fields can be set if required.\r\n\r\npd.mimetype - Sets the header content-type field.\r\npd.enable_cache - If True sets header fields to instruct the client to cache the file, if False requests no caching.\r\npd.content_length - Sets the header field with the file size.\r\n\r\nThe following attributes set Template page parameters:\r\n\r\npd.add_jscript - Set to a string containing javascript code. This will be set within the pages automatically generated \"$(document).ready(function(){})\" and will be run when the page is loaded.\r\n\r\npd.backcol - Set the 'HTML' tag background color\r\npd.body_class - The CSS class of the 'BODY' tag\r\npd.ident_data - Set to a string, which will be returned as the 'skicall.ident_data' attribute if this page submits any data. The data is base64 encoded and added to hidden fields on each form and link widget.\r\npd.lang - Set the language, such as 'en' in the page 'HTML' tag. This is independent of the skicall lang and language attributes, though it would generally be set the same as skicall.language.\r\npd.last_scroll - Set True to display the page at its last scroll position\r\npd.localStorage - A dictionary of string keys and values to set in the browser storage\r\npd.sessionStorage - A dictionary of string keys and values to set in the browser storage\r\npd.set_cookie - Set with a http.cookies.BaseCookie object which will be appended to the page headers.\r\npd.show_backcol - Set True to enable the 'HTML' tag background color\r\npd.show_error - Error message to be shown on the page default error widget\r\npd.interval - A template page can request a JSON page at set intervals, this sets the interval time in seconds. Use 0 to disable the requests.\r\npd.IntervalTarget - The label or ident of the target requested, typically a Responder which sets the data into a JSON page which is then returned.\r\npd.CatchToHTML - a target label or ident which is called if a javascript error occurs when the page is updated by JSON call.\r\n\r\nAttributes relevant to File pages:\r\n\r\npd.filepath - The path (relative to projectfiles) to the linked static file.\r\n\r\nFor SVG pages (dynamic created pages, not static files):\r\n\r\npd.height - Set the height\r\npd.width - Set the width\r\n\r\nFor CSS pages (dynamic created pages, not static files):\r\n\r\npd.cssimport - A string or a list\r\npd.colour_substitution - Set with a dictionary to substitute colours within the CSS file, see the ColourSubstitute Responder which uses this.\r\n\r\nFor JSON pages:\r\n\r\nThose Widgets which submit data, or link to another page, are generally set with the page to call, and an HTML template page is returned. However some widgets can request a JSON page (requires javascript to be enabled in the client browser).\r\nIn this case an alternative HTML page such as 'no_javascript' can be set in the HTML link field, which will be shown if the JSON call fails due to javascript being disabled.\r\nWhen a JSON request is made - you would typically call a Responder which sets the skicall data values into the target page 'general_json'. This being an empty JSON file which is then populated with the widget-field dictionary.\r\nOn being received by the client the page widget fields will be updated, this will be quick, as a whole page is not sent, and looks very dynamic.  Only certain widgfields are 'JSON enabled' and can be updated - this is shown in the widget documentation for each field.\r\nAs well as widgets, on setting up a Template Page you will see that the page can be set to make a JSON call at set intervals. Again this can be useful to continuously update required fields on the page.\r\n\r\nAs well as widgfields, some specific PageData attributes can be set and returned in the JSON response, which have a particular effect, these are:\r\n\r\npd.ident_data - Set to a string, which will be returned as the 'skicall.ident_data' attribute with any submitted data.\r\npd.ClearAllErrors - If True, any widget displaying an Error will be cleared.\r\npd.localStorage - A dictionary of string keys and values to set in the browser storage\r\npd.sessionStorage - A dictionary of string keys and values to set in the browser storage\r\n\r\npd.interval - The interval time in seconds which the template page will request JSON updates. Use 0 to disable the requests.\r\n\r\npd.IntervalTarget - The label or ident of the target requested, typically a Responder which sets the data into a JSON page which is then returned.\r\n\r\npd.JSONtoHTML - A url, label or ident to divert to.\r\n\r\nThis causes the client to call this target url.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the value 'CatchToHTML' can also be set.\r\n\r\npd.CatchToHTML - A label or ident.\r\n\r\nThis CatchToHTML target (typically a Responder leading to an HTML template) is called if the widgets being updated by a JSON call causes a javascript error of some sort, maybe due to an action not supported by the client browser. In this situation, the javascript error will be caught, and the CatchToHTML page will be called instead. This could be used in conjunction with:\r\n\r\npd.throw = \"Any error message\"\r\n\r\nThis causes a javascript exception to be thrown, and will cause the CatchToHTML page to be called, if one has been set. If CatchToHTML has not been set, then an alert box with the error message will be shown.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nPageData.from_dict(pagedict)\r\n\r\nThis classmethod returns an instance of the PageData class given a dictionary as produced by the to_dict method.\r\n\r\npd.to_dict()\r\n\r\nReturns a dictionary containing all the information of the PageData object, with keys as a string. This may be useful for storing the data in a cache or database.\r\n\r\npd.clear()\r\n\r\nClears all data from the instance.\r\n\r\npd.update(sectiondata)\r\n\r\nGiven a SectionData instance, updates the PageData object with the section data.\r\n\r\npd.get_section(sectionalias)\r\n\r\nIf this pd has been previously updated with a SectionData instance, then this method returns a SectionData object given the sectionalias. Returns None if the sectionalias is not recognised.\r\n\r\npd.delete_section(sectionalias)\r\n\r\nIf this pd has been previously updated with a SectionData instance, then this method deletes the section data given the sectionalias.\r\n\r\npd.get_value(sectionalias, widgetname, fieldname)\r\n\r\nReturns the value, if previously given, of the widget field. If the widget required is not in a section, set the sectionalias argument to None. This function returns None if no value has been set.",
  "aboutcode.SectionData": "As well as page widgets and fields, you can also set section widget and field data into the skicall object.\r\n\r\nTo do this, create a SectionData object.\r\n\r\nfrom skipole import SectionData\r\n\r\nsd = SectionData(\"sectionalias\")  - sectionalias being the alias given to the section when inserted into a page.\r\n\r\nThis instance is a dictionary-like object that also has certain attributes.

The dynamic content is created by your Python functions. The skipole framework does not provide any database functionality. All database activity should be provided by your code, even session cookie keys, though presented to your functions, are left to you to store.\r\n\r\nThis is done purposely, as you have all the power of Python.

The Responder also has a target page - this would be the Template Page which is then returned to the client browser.\r\n\r\nSince the Template Page is not called directly, it is usual to place Template pages under a folder set as 'Restricted' - which does not allow incoming calls to directly access them.\r\n\r\nSeveral different Responder types are available, some accept submitted data and place it into the skicall.call_data attribute, which is therefore available to you when submit_data(skicall) is called.\r\n\r\nYour submit_data function would typically populate a PageData object with values that will be set into the Template page which is returned to the caller.\r\n\r\nWhen adding a Responder, you will see that you can set various fields, including a 'Fail Page' - which is called should your code raise a FailPage exception, and also a list of strings, which are passed as the skicall.submit_list attribute.

You could, for example use this feature to direct the call to a log in page.\r\n\r\nIf the called_ident returned is that of a responder page, then depending on the responder, (or sequence of responders) further calls may be made to the submit_data function, and finally the end_call function will be called.\r\n\r\nOther optional return values:\r\n\r\nIf None is returned, the 'URL NOT FOUND' page will be automatically returned to the client.\r\n\r\nIf a string url is returned, then a redirector page will be sent to the client. A url would not normally be used to redirect to a page within the project, but could be used to redirect to an external site.\r\n\r\nIf a pathlib.Path object is returned, which contains the path to a local server file (not a url) - then that server file will be sent to the client. In this case, the submit_data and end_call functions will not be called. In this situation, your start_call function could optionally set values into a PageData object with attributes pagedata.status, pagedata.headers - or if headers is not set, pagedata.mimetype and pagedata.enable_cache. These are optional, if not set then the mimetype will be guessed from the filename extension.\r\n\r\nAlso see the skicall.map_url_to_server() method, which can be used to map a url folder to a folder of static files.\r\n\r\nNo un-caught exception should be raised in this function - if any are, the Server error page will be displayed.",
  "aboutcode.submit": "You should define the function:\r\n\r\nsubmit_data(skicall)\r\n\r\nThis function is called when a responder wishes to submit data for processing in some manner. This function typically should populate an instance of a PageData object - which is dictionary-like, with widgfields as keys, and values to insert into the fields.\r\n\r\nSuch a PageData object is then set into skicall using its update method, skicall.update(pagedata).\r\n\r\nUsing the /skiadmin pages, a responder is chosen from a list of responders by yourself, and added to this site like any other page. Each responder has a different functionality. Certain responders call this submit_data function. Typically a client web browser would make a call to a responder, which (after start_call is called) would set any received form data into the skicall.call_data dictionary, and then call the submit_data function.  Responders generally are set with a target ident - generally the ident of a template page, which will have its widgets populated by the data set into skicall.\r\n\r\nThe responder calling this function will specify what it wants returned in its documentation.\r\nMost responders require 'None' to be returned, but, for example, the LogIn responder requires a session string.\r\n\r\nIt is possible for one responder to pass the call to another, therefore this function could be called multiple times within a single call, skicall.ident_list is the list of such responder idents called - the first item being the responder ident called by the user, the last entry being the responder ident that called this function.\r\nEach ident in the list is a tuple of the form ('projname', pagenumber).\r\n\r\nskicall.submit_list is a list of strings which may be submitted by the responder calling this function.\r\nThey are optionally used for your convenience, and set when you add a responder to the project. If the 'use_submit_list' decorator is used, the submit_list can be used to specify an alternative function to submit_data. See the information about 'use_submit_list'.\r\n\r\nskicall.submit_dict is a dictionary which may be submitted by the responder calling this function.\r\nThe use depends on the responder - read the responder documentation.\r\n\r\nskicall.call_data is a dictionary which you can populate with your own data during the progress of the call. If you wish to clear it, use skicall.call_data.clear().\r\nTypically a responder would be used to pass submitted form data into this call_data dictionary prior to this function being called.\r\n\r\nOn returning from this function the call will be passed to the responder's target page, which could typically be a template page (in which case your end_call function will be called next) or it could be another responder.  If required a GoTo exception could be raised to jump elsewhere, or a FailPage exception could be raised to jump to the responders failure page with an error message.",
  "aboutcode.subprojects": "Typically your application will be served at '/', with the pages you create here being located beneath this root location.  However, you can also add another WSGIApplication object to be served at a location such as '/subproject'\r\n\r\nYour application object has the method add_project(subapplication, url=None, check_cookies=None)\r\n\r\nWhere subapplication is another WSGIApplication object, and url is where it will be served.  Initially 'skiadmin' is such a sub application, used to build your project but removed when you finally deploy it. You will also see the 'skis' sub application added, usually at url '/lib', this sub project is required as skis serves files needed by the framework.\r\n\r\nIf you want to add sub-projects you would typically:\r\n\r\n* Place the sub project code location on your sys.path\r\n* Import the sub project to obtain its wsgi application\r\n* Call application.add_project with the sub project application and the url where it will be served.\r\n\r\nThe two subprojects skis and skiadmin are included in the skipole package, with convenience functions that return their application. So in these cases you would have:\r\n\r\nfrom skipole import skis, skiadmin\r\n\r\nskis_application = skis.makeapp()\r\napplication.add_project(skis_application, url='/lib')\r\n\r\nskiadmin_application = skiadmin.makeapp(editedprojname=PROJECT)\r\napplication.add_project(skiadmin_application, url='/skiadmin')\r\n\r\nFor your deployed application, you would delete the skiadmin import and skiadmin_application lines, this would remove the /skiadmin facility.\r\n\r\nYou would normally leave the skis subproject, unless you are serving the javascript files some other way.\r\n\r\nThe optional check_cookies argument can be set to a function which you would create, with signature:\r\n\r\ndef my_check_cookies_function(received_cookies, proj_data):\r\n\r\nWhen a call is received, with a url that routes it to the sub application, if this function is defined, and set in the add_project method:\r\n\r\napplication.add_project(subapplication, url='/suburl', check_cookies=my_check_cookies_function)\r\n\r\nThen initially, before the call is routed to the subapplication, your my_check_cookies_function is called, with the received_cookies dictionary, and with your application's proj_data dictionary. If your function returns None, the call proceeds unhindered to the subapplication. If however your function returns an ident tuple, of the form (projectname, pagenumber), then the call is routed to that page instead.\r\n\r\nThis is typically used to limit access to the subproject. For example your my_check_cookies_function could check for a valid received cookie, and if present, would return None, allowing access, but if not present, it would return the ident of a login page.\r\n\r\nBesides an ident tuple, the function could just return a pagenumber, in which case the corresponding page of the root application would be called, or it could return a label, in which case the root application would check its label ident dictionary and find the target ident that way. The label should not point to a URL.",

This can be convenient. When you create a responder that calls 'submit_data' - you set the responder submit list to call the appropriate function in your code.\r\n\r\nIf you are providing a complex tree of packages and modules to handle the submit_data calls, this avoids the need to import them all into your top script, since the decorator will do the importing according to the submit_list.\r\n\r\nYour target functions should be of the form:\r\n\r\ndef function_name(skicall):\r\n.... < your code >\r\n\r\nYou do not have to use this decorator, if you prefer to use submit_list, or route functionality some other way, then that is your choice.",
