# This project needs to import the skipole package, which should normally be immediately
# available if skipole has been installed on your system.

# from skipole import the WSGIApplication class which will be used to create a wsgi
# application, and exception classes which you will need in your functions

from skipole import WSGIApplication, FailPage, GoTo, ValidateError, ServerError, set_debug

# The set_debug function is used during development, it adds exception data to server error
# pages, and also stops javascript validation of input data on the client - this ensures that
# server validation can be tested

# You may also wish to import 'use_submit_list' which can act as a decorator around your
# submit_data function. See the skipole documentation for details.

# the framework needs to know the location of the projectfiles directory holding this and
# other projects - specifically the skis and skiadmin projects
# The following line assumes, as default, that this script file is located beneath
# ...projectfiles/newproj/code/

# This creates a WSGI application object. On being created the object uses the projectfiles location to find
# and load json files which define the project, and also uses the functions :
#     start_call, submit_data, end_call
# to populate returned pages.
# proj_data is an optional dictionary which you may use for your own purposes,
# it is included as the skicall.proj_data attribute


# The skis application must always be added, without skis you're going nowhere!
# The skis sub project serves javascript files required by the framework widgets.

if skis_code not in sys.path:
    sys.path.append(skis_code)
import skis
skis_application = skis.makeapp(PROJECTFILES)
application.add_project(skis_application, url='/lib')

# The add_project method of application, enables the added sub application
# to be served at a URL which should extend the URL of the main 'root' application.
# The above shows the main newproj application served at "/" and the skis library
# project served at "/lib"

# Note if you want to add further sub-projects you would typically:
#     Place the sub project code location on your sys.path
#     Import the sub project to obtain its wsgi application
#     Call application.add_project with the sub project application
#     and the url where it will be served.


# to deploy on a web server, you would typically install skipole on the web server,
# together with a 'projectfiles' directory containing the projects you want
# to serve (typically this project, and the skis project).
# you would then follow the web servers own documentation which should describe how
# to load a wsgi application.

# for example, using gunicorn3 by command line

# gunicorn3 -w 4 newproj:application

# Where gunicorn3 is the python3 version of gunicorn
