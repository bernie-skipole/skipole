This is done so you can delete the Responder and set another, such as a 'SubmitData' Responder which will call your submit_data function if you wish to dynamically insert data into this template.\r\n\r\nThis page has been set with an \"error_messages.ErrorPara\" widget as its 'default error widget' - normally hidden, but will be displayed if an error condition is raised leading to this page.\r\n\r\nThis text is set in a TextBlock with reference 'welcome_text' - your next step is to call /skiadmin and edit the body of page 2001 to remove the TextBlock and add your own content."
