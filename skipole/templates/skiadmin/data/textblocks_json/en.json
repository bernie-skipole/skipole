  "aboutcode.intro": "The whole point of your project is to create a WSGI application using:\r\n\r\napplication = WSGIApplication(project, projectfiles, proj_data, start_call, submit_data, end_call, url)\r\n\r\nThis 'application' is a WSGI callable, typically called by a WSGI compatible server as:\r\n\r\napplication(environ, start_response)\r\n\r\nWhich then serves your required pages. When created it builds the application from JSON files (which are developed using skiadmin), and as calls are received it passes data to your Python start_call, submit_data and end_call functions.\r\n\r\nproject is your project name.\r\n\r\nprojectfiles is the path to your directory containing your projects.\r\n\r\nproj_data is an optional dictionary you can set, which will be passed to your functions.\r\n\r\nurl is the path, default '/' where the project will be served. \r\n\r\nThe WSGIApplication class requires you to define, and provide the functions:\r\n\r\n start_call(called_ident, skicall)\r\n\r\n submit_data(skicall)\r\n\r\n end_call(page_ident, page_type, skicall)\r\n\r\nThese functions in turn can call your own packages and modules, to populate the 'skicall.page_data' attribute which fills in field values of the widgets in the page returned to the caller.\r\n\r\nAs a call arrives at the server, 'start_call' is called.  If you set a Responder to receive a call, it may call 'submit_data', and finally, just before a template page is returned, 'end_call' is called.\r\n\r\nYour code can import four exceptions which you can use in your functions.\r\n\r\nfrom skipole import FailPage, GoTo, ValidateError, ServerError\r\n\r\nThese can be used by your functions to generate error conditions, or in the case of GoTo, to force a jump to another page.",
  "aboutcode.notprovided": "The skiadmin sub project is used to develop your project, saving page definitions, TextBlocks etc., into JSON files which are read when the WSGIApplication object is created.\r\n\r\nOnce your project is deployed, without skiadmin, these JSON files are only read - not written to. The dynamic content is created by your Python functions. The skipole framework does not provide any database functionality. All database activity should be provided by your code, even session cookie keys, though presented to your functions, are left to you to store.\r\n\r\nThis is done purposely, as you have all the power of Python. Typically you would use Redis to store keys, and you have any number of databases at your disposal. This allows Skipole itself to have no dependencies (it uses JQuery and W3.CSS - but these are bundled in to skipole), it also does not dictate to you how and where your data originates from.\r\n\r\nSkipole uses Python3 - not Python2. The 'development server' initially used is simply derived from the Python library wsgiref.simple_server.\r\n\r\nNo guarantee of performance or security is given, the development of skipole is a one person hobby, and in the absence of any third party testing I am unable to give any assurances of its suitability for anything at all. Hope you enjoy having a go with it though :)",
  "aboutcode.page_data": "Your 'start_call', 'submit_data' and 'end_call' functions are used to populate the attribute 'skicall.page_data' which is a dictionary. This dictionary contents are used to set the widget fields of the final template page returned.\r\n\r\nThe keys of page_data are of the form:\r\n\r\nIf a widget is in a section:\r\nskicall.page_data[sectionalias,widgetname,fieldname] = value\r\n\r\nIf a widget is not in a section:\r\nskicall.page_data[widgetname,fieldname] = value\r\n\r\nThis framework often refers to the key tuple (widgetname,fieldname) as a widgfield.\r\n\r\nMost of the skicall.page_data fields will be of the above form, however there are keys which set certain parameters, optionally overriding parameters set when the page is created:\r\n\r\nskicall.page_data[sectionalias, 'hide'] - Set True to hide the section\r\nskicall.page_data[sectionalias, 'multiplier'] - A section can be displayed multiple times - this sets the number of times this section to be shown\r\nskicall.page_data[sectionalias, 'multiplier_tag'] - Set the section tag containing each section when multiplied\r\nskicall.page_data[sectionalias, 'section_class'] - Set CSS class on the section\r\nskicall.page_data[sectionalias, 'show'] - Set False to remove the section\r\n\r\nThese literal string keys set page parameters:\r\n\r\nskicall.page_data['add_jscript'] - Set to a string containing javascript code. This will be set within the pages automatically generated \"$(document).ready(function(){})\" and will be run when the page is loaded.\r\n\r\nskicall.page_data['backcol'] - Set the 'HTML' tag background color\r\nskicall.page_data['body_class'] - The CSS class of the 'BODY' tag\r\nskicall.page_data['headers'] - Sets the returned page headers\r\nskicall.page_data['ident_data'] - Set to a string, which will be returned as the 'skicall.ident_data' attribute if this page submits any data.\r\nskicall.page_data['lang'] - Set the language, such as 'en' in the page 'HTML' tag. This is independent of the skicall lang and language attributes, though it would generally be set the same as skicall.language.\r\nskicall.page_data['last_scroll'] - Set True to display the page at its last scroll position\r\nskicall.page_data['localStorage'] - A dictionary of string keys and values to set in the browser storage\r\nskicall.page_data['sessionStorage'] - A dictionary of string keys and values to set in the browser storage\r\nskicall.page_data['show_backcol'] - Set True to enable the 'HTML' tag background color\r\nskicall.page_data['show_error'] - Error message to be shown on the page default error widget\r\nskicall.page_data['status'] - Sets the returned page status\r\nskicall.page_data['CatchToHTML'] - a target label or ident which is called if a javascript error occurs when the page is updated by JSON call.\r\n\r\nFor File pages:\r\n\r\nskicall.page_data['filepath'] - The path (relative to projectfiles) to the linked static file.\r\nskicall.page_data['mimetype'] - The mime type of the file.\r\nskicall.page_data['enable_cache'] - If True instructs the client to cache the file.\r\n\r\nFor SVG pages (dynamic created pages, not static files):\r\n\r\nskicall.page_data['height'] - Set the height\r\nskicall.page_data['width'] - Set the width\r\nskicall.page_data['enable_cache'] - Enables client cache of this page.\r\n\r\nFor CSS pages (dynamic created pages, not static files):\r\n\r\nskicall.page_data['@import'] - A string or a list\r\nskicall.page_data['enable_cache'] - Enables client cache of this page.\r\n\r\nFor JSON pages:\r\n\r\nThose Widgets which submit data, or link to another page, are generally set with the page to call, and an HTML template page is returned. However some widgets can request a JSON page (requires javascript to be enabled in the client browser).\r\nIn this case an alternative HTML page such as 'no_javascript' can be set in the HTML link field, which will be shown if the JSON call fails due to javascript being disabled.\r\nWhen a JSON request is made - you would typically call a Responder which sets the skicall.page_data widgfield/values into the target page 'general_json'. This being an empty JSON file which is then populated with the dictionary.\r\nOn being received by the client the page widget fields will be updated, this will be quick, as a whole page is not sent, and looks very dynamic.  Only certain widgfields are 'JSON enabled' and can be updated - this is shown in the widget documentation for each field.\r\nAs well as widgets, on setting up a Template Page you will see that the page can be set to make a JSON call at set intervals. Again this can be useful to continuously update required fields on the page.\r\n\r\nAs well as widgfields, the JSONtoHTML value can be set when returning a JSON page:\r\n\r\nskicall.page_data['JSONtoHTML'] - A url, label or ident to divert to.\r\n\r\nThis causes the client to call this target url.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the value 'CatchToHTML' can also be set.\r\n\r\nskicall.page_data['CatchToHTML'] - A label or ident.\r\n\r\nThis CatchToHTML target (typically a Responder leading to an HTML template) is called if the widgets being updated by a JSON call causes a javascript error of some sort, maybe due to an action not supported by the client browser. In this situation, the javascript error will be caught, and the CatchToHTML page will be called instead. This could be used in conjunction with:\r\n\r\nskicall.page_data['throw'] = \"Any error message\"\r\n\r\nThis causes a javascript exception to be thrown, and will cause the CatchToHTML page to be called, if one has been set. If CatchToHTML has not been set, then an alert box with the error message will be shown.",
  "aboutcode.responders": "The link to 'Root Folder' on the left navigation menu will show the project folder and page hierarchy, and gives you options to add further folders and pages. When you add a page you will have the option to add several page types, including 'Responders' and 'Template Pages'.\r\n\r\nTypically you would add a Responder - which is the page which actually accepts an incoming call, and this Responder would call your submit_data function.  The Responder also has a target page - this would be the Template Page which is then returned to the client browser.\r\n\r\nSince the Template Page is not called directly, it is usual to place Template pages under a folder set as 'Restricted' - which does not allow incoming calls to directly access them.\r\n\r\nSeveral different Responder types are available, some accept submitted data and place it into the skicall.call_data attribute, which is therefore available to you when submit_data(skicall) is called.\r\n\r\nYour submit_data function would typically populate the skicall.page_data attribute with values that will be set into the Template page which is returned to the caller.\r\n\r\nWhen adding a Responder, you will see that you can set various fields, including a 'Fail Page' - which is called should your code raise a FailPage exception, and also a list of strings, which are passed as the skicall.submit_list attribute.  These strings could be used, for example, to inform your submit_data function which Responder has called it.",

If the widget displaying the error message has a field called 'code', it will be set to this code number.\r\n\r\nIf you want to present your own code numbers, please avoid the 90000 to 99999 range.\r\n\r\nNormally leave section and widget empty to allow the message to be displayed in the page default error widget.",
  "aboutcode.skicall": "The skicall object passed to your functions has several attributes, most provide you with information - some you can alter:\r\n\r\nskicall.accesstextblocks is the project instance of the AccessTextBlocks class, most users will not need this, but it may be required for certain applications.\r\n\r\nskicall.call_data is a dictionary which could contain data you set into it or could contain submitted form data (depending on the Responder handling the call).\r\n\r\nskicall.caller_ident is the ident of the page making the call, a tuple ('projname', pagenumber), generally sent with any submitted data, this value could be an empty tuple if the page ident is not known - which will happen if the calling page is external or if no data is submitted.\r\n\r\nskicall.environ is the wsgi environ dictionary.\r\n\r\nskicall.ident_data is a string which was previously saved onto the page making the call by setting skicall.page_data['ident_data'], and has now been sent back together with any submitted data.\r\nThis facility can therefore be used to pass a reference identifier between calls. You need to validate this string here as it can be altered by a malicious caller. ident_data will be None if not present.\r\n\r\nskicall.ident_list is initially an empty list but will have the ident ('projname', pagenumber) of each responder handling the call appended to it. Typically a call will be handled by a single responder, but it is possible for one responder to pass the call on to another, and so several may be involved in a call.\r\n\r\nskicall.lang is a read-only tuple of two strings containing the preferred language required by the client in the format (language, default_language).\r\nThis attribute is used when requesting TextBlocks.\r\n\r\nskicall.language is a string such as 'en' being the preferred language required by the client, initially taken from the client browser's language setting, or from a received language cookie. If changed it will cause a language cookie to be set. It may be that the client browser preferred language is not available, hence this is independent of the skicall.page_data['lang'] setting - which, if used, sets the page html tag 'lang' attribute.\r\n\r\nskicall.page_data is a dictionary to be populated by your functions during the progress of this call.\r\nIt consists of a dictionary of {widgfields:values,...} which will be set in the final template page.\r\n\r\nNote: a widgfield is a tuple ('widgetname', 'fieldname'), or a tuple ('sectionalias','widgetname', 'fieldname') if the widget is part of a section. \r\n\r\nskicall.path is the URL path to the page called.\r\n\r\nskicall.proj_data is a project attribute, a dictionary set when creating the skipole.WSGIApplication object.

If no label is found, returns None.\r\n\r\nskicall.textblock(textref, project=None) is a method which given a reference string returns the text of the associated TextBlock.\r\nIf project is None, it assumes the TextBlock is defined in the current project, if project is given it must be the root or a sub project. If no TextBlock is found, it returns None.\r\n\r\nskicall.projectpaths() returns a dictionary of project names as keys with the project paths as values.",
  "aboutcode.skilift": "Within the 'skipole' package there is a 'skilift' sub-package, which contains further modules and functions providing project information and editing capability.

Each responder has a different functionality. Certain responders call this submit_data function. Typically a client web browser would make a call to a responder, which (after start_call is called) would set any received form data into the skicall.call_data dictionary, and then call the submit_data function.  Responders generally are set with a target ident - generally the ident of a template page, which will have its widgets populated by the skicall.page_data dictionary.\r\n\r\nThe responder calling this function will specify what it wants returned in its documentation.\r\nMost responders require 'None' to be returned, but, for example, the LogIn responder requires a session string.\r\n\r\nIt is possible for one responder to pass the call to another, therefore this function could be called multiple times within a single call, skicall.ident_list is the list of such responder idents called - the first item being the responder ident called by the user, the last entry being the responder ident that called this function.\r\nEach ident in the list is a tuple of the form ('projname', pagenumber).\r\n\r\nskicall.submit_list is a list of strings which may be submitted by the responder calling this function.\r\nThey are optionally used for your convenience, and set when you add a responder to the project.

Default values are only applied if a default for the widget and field has been set, and only in page widgets - not in sections.\r\n\r\nProject <html> background color:\r\nIn general, the background colour of pages are set in each page 'body' element, however on a slowly loading site, before the body is loaded, it can happen that a brief white page is shown.\r\nOne solution is to set a background colour in the very first 'html' element of the page. Each template page of your project has the option to set this attribute, and for all such pages, you can set the background colour here. This allows you to change this setting across the entire project without editing each page.\r\n\r\nSet CSS class in <body> tags:\r\nThe CSS class of the body tag can be set for all template pages in the project. This allows a drastic CSS change throughout the project if required.\r\n\r\nDefault CSS links:\r\nWhen new pages are created, default CSS links can automatically be inserted into the page head section.
