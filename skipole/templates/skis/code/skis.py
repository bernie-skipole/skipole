#
#  To use this module - in your own code you would normally create your own 'application' object
#  and then call this module's makeapp function to produce a 'skis_application'
#  You would then add skis_application to your application using
#  application.add_project(skis_application, url='/lib')
#
#  The only difficulty is importing this module, however as skis.py should normally be in
#  PROJECTFILES/skis/code/skis.py
#  this directory can be added to the python path. So you would include
#  the following in your own code:
#
#  skis_code = os.path.join(PROJECTFILES, 'skis', 'code')
#  if skis_code not in sys.path:
#      sys.path.append(skis_code)
#  import skis
#  skis_application = skis.makeapp(PROJECTFILES)
#  application.add_project(skis_application, url='/lib')
